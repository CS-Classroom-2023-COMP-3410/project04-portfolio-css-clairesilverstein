I used the Bulma CSS framework which I really enjoyed and would use it again. I was originally overwhelmed with how to incoorperate CSS into my project, but the framework helped me stay organized and feel less overwhelemed. I also used the strategy I figured out was best in the last project. I had chatGBT help with the initial outline and then asked questions about where I could make specific changes rather than having chat edit the code it originally wrote. That worked really well for me and I had to redo a lot less of my code this way. Overall, I feel like I am gaining a better understanding of how to incooperate CSS into my projects.
